# Sentiment Analysis using RNN

This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis model implemented using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model is trained to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment categories.

## 🚀 Features
- Implemented using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, padding)
- Uses **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec / GloVe / Custom Embeddings)**
- Trained on a sentiment dataset (IMDB / Twitter Sentiment / Custom Dataset)
- Evaluation metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- Visualization of model performance using **Matplotlib/Seaborn**
