This covers the most common packages used for sentiment analysis applications:
streamlit - for the web app framework
pandas and numpy - for data handling
nltk - Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
scikit-learn - for machine learning components
matplotlib and seaborn - for visualizations
transformers and torch - if you're using modern transformer-based models like BERT
vaderSentiment - for rule-based sentiment analysis
textblob - another popular sentiment analysis library


If your app specifically uses different libraries or versions, you should adjust this list. For example:

If you're using spaCy for NLP: add spacy
If you're using HuggingFace's specific models: ensure transformers is included
If you have custom version requirements: specify them with == (e.g., streamlit==1.24.0)

You can create this file in your project directory and then add, commit, and push it to GitHub along with your code.
